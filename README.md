## Log

Had to replace some content in parse_json to make it work properly

Changed string to be std::string_view in parsing.

2023-04-03 Had to fix parsing manually.

Made ChatGPT-4 write a dump function.

Worked with outputing arbitry serialized json data. ChatGPT came up with a
version that did not work, but after modifying the code I got it to work.

Also asked the chat to provide example data. So nice to not have to do that on my
own
